Hepatitis C is a viral infection that affects the liver, leading to chronic conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and an increased risk of liver cancer. Velpatasvir, when combined with sofosbuvir, has been shown to be highly effective in achieving sustained virological response (SVR), leading to the eradication of the virus in most patients. The ongoing prevalence of Hepatitis C in the United States continues to drive the demand for these combination therapies, particularly as new cases are diagnosed and as healthcare providers focus on achieving better long-term outcomes for patients. These factors contribute to the large and growing market share of Velpatasvir in Hepatitis C treatment, with an expanding number of patients seeking highly effective therapies that improve their quality of life and reduce the risk of serious complications. As the U.S. healthcare landscape evolves, the accessibility of Hepatitis C treatments such as Velpatasvir is becoming more widespread, largely due to expanded insurance coverage, including through public health programs like Medicaid. Government initiatives aimed at eliminating Hepatitis C by 2030 are expected to further boost the adoption of Velpatasvir-based therapies. Additionally, the market is benefiting from ongoing research into alternative drug formulations and treatment regimens that may reduce treatment durations or enhance patient outcomes. As the standard of care improves and the number of cases diagnosed continues to grow, the market for Velpatasvir in Hepatitis C treatment is projected to maintain strong momentum. <h2>Other Subsegment Description</h2> <p>The "Other" subsegment of the United States Velpatasvir market includes various applications outside of Hepatitis C treatment, where the drug's antiviral properties may be utilized for other viral infections or off-label uses. While the primary focus of Velpatasvir has been its role in Hepatitis C treatment, research and development are exploring its potential in other conditions, including Hepatitis B, HIV, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In particular, studies into the use of Velpatasvir in combination with other antivirals to treat multi-drug resistant viral infections are underway, which could broaden the market opportunities for the drug. Though these areas are not as developed as Hepatitis C, the growing recognition of Velpatasvir’s broad antiviral activity is driving interest from both pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals. The expansion of Velpatasvir’s use in "Other" viral infections offers significant opportunities for market growth, particularly as the scientific community continues to investigate its efficacy in treating a range of chronic viral diseases. If clinical trials for these conditions show positive results, Velpatasvir could be positioned as a key player in combating a wider array of viral infections, creating a new revenue stream for manufacturers. However, this subsegment will likely see slower adoption compared to Hepatitis C due to regulatory hurdles, the need for clinical evidence, and the presence of alternative therapies. Nonetheless, the potential for Velpatasvir in broader applications is an important factor for the long-term prospects of the U.S. market. <h2>Key Trends in the Velpatasvir Market</h2> <p>Several key trends are shaping the U.S. Velpatasvir market.
